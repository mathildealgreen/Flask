For our DIS-project we made a website that lets you search for movies and TV-shows and add them to your favorites list.

How to compile our project? 
Open postgresSQL and change the password in the app.py to your own password.

Install the needed libraries (flask, psycopg2, werkzeug.security,logging,nltk,random).

By using the following command in the terminal: 
pip install -r requirements.txt 

Run the project?
python app.py

You will first enter the 'login' site. First press "join now" to make an account.
Then 'login' with your freshly made account. From the search site you can search titles such as "paranoia" or "squid game" or you can try a number in the duration bar - try with "2".
From the search results list you can add the movie or TV-show to your favorites list. Here you can also delete movies and shows from your list.

Enjoy :-)
